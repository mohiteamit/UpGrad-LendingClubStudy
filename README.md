# UpGrad | EDA | Lending Club Case study
The primary objective of this case study is to understand the factors that influence loan default in a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The aim is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default on their loan, which can help the company make informed decisions to minimize financial losses. Specifically, the company wants to distinguish between borrowers who are likely to repay the loan and those who are at risk of defaulting (labeled as 'charged-off').

## Recommendations
1. **Interest Rate Adjustments:**
   - Consider implementing stricter criteria for approving loans with higher interest rates, as these are strongly associated with defaults. Adjust the interest rate model to better reflect the risk of default.

2. **Loan Grade Improvements:**
   - Enhance the loan grading system to more accurately capture the risk of default. Focus on tightening criteria for lower grades and provide incentives for higher-grade loans.

3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio Monitoring:**
   - Implement closer monitoring of borrowers with high DTI ratios. Consider offering financial counseling or debt management support to these borrowers.

4. **Targeted Marketing and Risk Management:**
   - Focus marketing efforts on borrowers with higher annual incomes and longer credit histories, as these factors are associated with lower default risk.
   - Develop targeted risk management strategies for borrowers with lower incomes and shorter credit histories.

5. **Employment Stability:**
   - Incorporate employment length as a more significant factor in the loan approval process. Offer loan products tailored to borrowers with stable, long-term employment.

6. **Enhanced Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - Continuously improve data collection methods to capture more granular information about borrower behavior and financial health. Regularly update the analysis to reflect changing trends and patterns in loan defaults.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can better identify and manage the risk of loan defaults, ultimately reducing financial losses and improving overall loan portfolio performance.
