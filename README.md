# Project Name
> The primary objective of this case study is to understand the factors that influence loan default in a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The aim is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default on their loan, which can help the company make informed decisions to minimize financial losses. Specifically, the company wants to distinguish between borrowers who are likely to repay the loan and those who are at risk of defaulting (labeled as 'charged-off').
